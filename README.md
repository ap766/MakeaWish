# Dreams Come True

## SYNOPSIS

Dreams Come True is a locally based wish granting organisation dedicated to using the power of a dream to bring hope and joy to every citizen battling with a physical disability. 

Dreams come in all shapes and sizes, serving as a momentary reprieve from the doctors tests, medical treatments and hospital visits.They go a long way in inspiring courage to battle every hardship coming our way, spreading positivity and in keeping the flames of hope glowing warm and strong as we strive to become the best versions of ourselves. 

We provide a platform for people with disabilities to express their lifelong desires and see them come true. We invite people of all our races, colour and creed to contribute and provide monetary support towards the fulfillment of these dreams. Furthermore, our organisation encourages engagement and interaction establishing a personal level of connection. Our team of highly qualified experts guide all individuals part of this growing community to becoming more empathetic and persevering beings. 

It is rightly said that courage can be contagious and hope can take on a life of its own. This hope lies in dreams, in imagination, and in the courage of those who dare to make dreams into reality. Our organisation is dedicated to being a part of this everlasting 
journey of dreaming, inspiring and believing as we continue touching lives across the globe. 
We aim to leave a lasting impression on people and remind them to let their hopes, and not their hurts, shape their future. 

We hope that as you go about living your extraordinary lives, you remember, that Dreams Come True!
